## Lab 4: Question 10

I'm making a Powerpoint in Quarto. At this very moment! Can you believe it?

## About Me

My name is **Jata**

-   My favorite word: Bihebdomadaire

-   My favorite math equation:

    ```{r}
    x = 87/34 * 2 **2
    print(x)
    ```

## Code

Here's some code for you to look at, and grade :( .

```{r}
for (i in (1:10)){
  print(i)
}
```

## Finish Line

Are we done already? Whew that was a *blast*. TTYL!
